        <div class="left-text body-text">
            <p>My name is Gabriel De Oliveira (he/him/his). I am an aspiring software developer born in Brazil and living in the United States.</p>
            <p>At 7 years old, I grew a deep passion for video games, such as <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i>, <i>Super Mario</i>, and <i>Jak and Daxter</i>. This passion has helped me discover my interest in programming and learning more about what goes on under the hood of many forms of software. Initially getting a degree in music performance, I have decided to make the switch to software development in order to dive deeper into this passion I have had since a young age.</p>
            <p>Some of my interests outside of programming and video games include playing drums, watching anime, going out to try new local places with friends and family, and looking at cat videos.</p>
